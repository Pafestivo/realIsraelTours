    description: `Real Israel Tours also offers powerful spiritual Christian trips to the Holy Land. Walk where Jesus walked guided by experts in biblical history and watch the Bible come to life. Participants feel struck with spiritual energy on our journeys through the most important sites in Christianity. Near the Galilee, choose to visit Nazareth, Jesus’s hometown, Capernaum, where Jesus began his ministry, preached, and performed miracles, and the Mount of Beatitudes, where he preached the Sermon on the Mount. We offer opportunities to submerge yourself in the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist, and sail on the Sea of Galilee as the disciples did. In Jerusalem, whether you want a more educational tour or a spiritual procession, you will walk Via Dolorosa, the way of sorrows/suffering, the path Jesus carried his cross through Jerusalem’s old city to the Church of Holy Sepulchre, where he was crucified and buried. We also recommend a pilgrimage to the oldest continuous site of worship in Christianity, the Church of Nativity in Bethlehem.

    You can also take the opportunity to visit any of Israel’s dozens of other powerful Christian sites. Choose to visit the Mount of Olives, the Church of All Nations, Mount Tabor, Valley of Elah, Tabgha, The Garden Tomb, Mount Zion, the room of the Last Supper, Caesarea National Park, Mount Sodom, or others. In addition to compelling tours of the most famous sites, we are well versed in any and all Christian sites across the Holy Land, ready to suggest additional unique places and activities that might peak your unique group’s interests.
    
    We accommodate anything from small family trips to larger Christian organizations and look forward to customizing a trip with your group’s preferred balance of history and spirituality, creative experiences and archeological sites, fun activities and empowering moments.`,
